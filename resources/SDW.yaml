  title: U.S. EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) - Safe Drinking Water Act
  description: |-
    Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public use. ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for about 800,000 regulated facilities nationwide.
    <BR><BR>SDW Rest Services provides multiple service endpoints, each with specific capabilities, to search and retrieve data on public water systems regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) .
    The returned results reflect data drawn from EPA's Federal Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) database.
    <BR><BR>
    The get_systems, get_qid, and get_download end points are meant to be used together.
    <br><br>
    The recommended use scenario for get_systems, get_qid, and get_downoad is:
    <br>
    <br><b>1)</b>&nbsp Use get_systems to validate passed query parameters, obtain summary statistics and to obtain a query_id (QID).  QIDs are time sensitive and will be valid for approximately 30 minutes.
    <br><b>2)</b>&nbsp Use get_qid, with the returned QID, to paginate through arrays of water system results.
    <br><b>3)</b>&nbsp Use get_download, with the returned QID, to generate a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file of water system information that meets the QID query criteria.
    <br>
    <br>
    Use the qcolumns parameter to customize your search results.  Use the Metdata service endpoint for a list of available output objects, their Column Ids, and their definitions to help you build your customized output.
