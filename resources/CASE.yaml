  title: U.S. EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) - Enforcement Case Search
  description: |-
    Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public use. ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for about 800,000 regulated facilities nationwide.
    <BR><BR>CASE Rest Services provide multiple service endpoints, each with specific capabilities, to search and retrieve data on civil cases entered into the 
    Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS) and criminal cases entered into the Summary of Criminal Prosecutions database.  
    See Enforcement Case Search Help (https://echo.epa.gov/help/enforcement-case-search-help) for additional information on searching civil and criminal cases. 
    <BR><BR>
    The get_cases, get_map, get_qid, and get_download end points are meant to be used together.<br>  
    The recommended use scenario for get_cases, get_qid, get_map, and get_downoad is:
    <br>
    <br><b>1)</b>&nbsp Use get_cases to validate passed query parameters, obtain summary statistics and to obtain a query_id (QID).  QIDs are time sensitive and will be valid for approximately 30 minutes.
    <br><b>2)</b>&nbsp Use get_qid, with the returned QID, to paginate through arrays of case results.
    <br><b>3)</b>&nbsp Use get_map, with the returned QID, to zoom in/out and pan on the clustered and individual facility coordinates, related to the returned cases, that meet the QID query criteria.
    <br><b>4)</b>&nbsp Use get_download, with the returned QID, to generate a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file of facility information that meets the QID query criteria.
    <br><br>
    In addition to the service endpoints listed above there are two detailed case report services, one for civil cases (get_case_report) and one for criminal cases (get_crcase_report). 
    See the Civil Enforcement Case Report Help (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/enforcement-case-report-help) and the Criminal Case Report Help (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/criminal-case-report-help) for additional information 
    on then data returned from these two services.

          Identifies the type of action based on the enforcement authority used.  
          Administrative Formal Cases are non-judicial enforcement actions taken by EPA or a state under its own authority, without involving a judicial court process. An administrative action by EPA or a state agency may be in the form of:
          - A notice of violation or a Superfund notice letter.
          -> An administrative order or order (either with or without penalties) directing an individual, a business, or other entity to take action to come into compliance, or to clean up a site.
          Judicial Cases are formal lawsuits, filed in court, against persons or entities that have failed to comply with statutory or regulatory requirements, with an administrative order, or who owe EPA response costs for cleaning up a Superfund site. These cases are filed by the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of EPA and, in regulatory cases, by the State's Attorneys General for the states as well.
          Criminal Cases occur when EPA or a state enforce against a company or person through a criminal action. Criminal actions are usually reserved for the most serious violations, those that are willful, or knowingly committed. A court conviction can result in fines or imprisonment.
