          - AFS: Air Facility System for Clean Air Act stationary source programs.
          - ICP: Integrated Compliance Information System for Clean Water Act programs monitoring National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits.
          - RCR: Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Information System (RCRAInfo) for tracking the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) programs.
          - NCDB: National Compliance Database System for monitoring national performance of the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); the Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know Act, Section 313 (EPCRA); the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response (AHERA); and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
          - TRI: Toxics Release Inventory for Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Section 313 submissions.
          - NEI: National Emissions Inventory database contains information on stationary and mobile sources that emit criteria air pollutants and their precursors, as well as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The database includes estimates of annual emissions, by source, of air pollutants in each area of the country, on an annual basis.

          This field provides further description on type of permit or record for each data system as follows:
          - For CAA  = The program office defines each CAA Source ID and the associated permits as being Federally Reportable or Non-Federally Reportable. Under the CAA, federally reportable sources include majors, synthetic minors, NESHAP Part 61 minors, minors with an unresolved High Priority Violation (HPV), with recent enforcement actions, or included on a Compliance Monitoring Strategy plan. The Clean Air Act requires that delegated agencies and EPA track all federally reportable sources in Air Facility System (AFS).
          - For CWA  = Each CWA Source ID or National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit is defined by the program office as a Major or Minor discharger.
          - For RCRA = RCRA Source ID or permits for Treatment, Storage and Disposal facilities are identified by TSD, Large Quantity Generators are identified by LQG. Other values include Permit Workload (PMT), Closure Workload (CLO), Small Quantity Generator Universe (SQG), Conditionally-Exempt Small Quantity Generator (CESQG), Post-Closure Workload (POST CL), and Transporters.

          For CWA, the Permit Compliance System (PCS) designates a permitted facility as being Active or Inactive. Under the CWA, all facilities discharging pollutants from a point source (e.g., a pipe) to surface waters must have a NPDES permit. For CWA, ICISNPDES designates a permit as Effective, Administratively Continued, Expired, Not Needed, Pending, Retired, or Terminated. RCRA facilities (sites) are designated as Active or Inactive. The following provides RCRA site activity status definitions and explains site activity status designation.
